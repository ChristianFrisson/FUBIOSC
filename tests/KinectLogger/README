KinectLogger allows to create a video containing the depth map and camera image. This functionaly is optional. It requires QtFFmpegWrapper (http://code.google.com/p/qtffmpegwrapper/)

To enable the video functionalty make sure have QtFFmpegWrapper (http://code.google.com/p/qtffmpegwrapper/) somewhere and do the following in the .pro file:
1) DEFINES += WRITEVIDEO
2) Set the FFmpeg path (include and library)

If WRITEVIDEO is not defined, then the video output functionality is disabled and QtFFmpegWrapper isn't required. No other changes to the code is required.
